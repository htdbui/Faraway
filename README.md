# Faraway: Linear Models with Python

Welcome to the **Faraway** project! This repository contains the data and code from the textbook "Linear Models with Python" by Professor Faraway. The project reorganizes the code into datasets, summarizes the theory, and provides expanded explanations for both the theory and the code. It also includes some rewritten code and clearer variable names.

## Overview

This project is a personal endeavor to better understand the material in the "Linear Models with Python" textbook. It includes:

- Reorganized code for each dataset.
- Summarized theory with additional explanations.
- Modified code with clearer variable names.
- Examples in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Markdown files in both German and English.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
