    "- Missing Cases: Sometimes we fail to observe a complete case $(x_i, y_i)$. When drawing a sample, unsampled cases are naturally unobserved, which is standard in statistics. However, occasionally, intended samples are missed. If this failure is unrelated to the observations, we simply have a smaller sample and can proceed normally. Conversely, if the failure is related to the observations, it results in a biased sample. With enough information about the missingness mechanism, corrections can be made to achieve valid inferences.\n",
    "- Incomplete Values: In an experiment studying light bulb lifetimes, we might end the experiment before all bulbs die. These incomplete cases only show that a bulb lasted at least a certain time, but not the exact duration. Similar situations occur in medical trials with unknown patient outcomes. Such cases are censored, and methods like survival analysis or reliability analysis can handle them.\n",
    "- Missing Values: Sometimes, we observe only some components of a case. We might see values for some predictors but not others, or observe predictors without the response.\n",
    "- In this chapter, we address missing values. Biased sampling can be mitigated by covariate adjustment. Methods for censored data are available in other books. The best option is finding the missing values, though this might not be possible. Next, we ask why the data are missing and distinguish several kinds of missingness.\n",
    "- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR): The probability of a value being missing is the same for all cases. Deleting cases with missing values causes no bias but may result in a loss of information.\n",
    "- Missing at Random (MAR): The probability of a value being missing depends on a known mechanism. For example, in social surveys, certain groups may be less likely to provide information. If we know the group membership, we can adjust for it in the regression model and delete the missing cases. Better methods than deletion will be discussed later.\n",
    "- Missing Not at Random (MNAR): The probability of a value being missing depends on an unobserved variable or the value itself. For example, individuals hiding something might not provide certain information. Handling MNAR is difficult, so we focus on MAR. Determining the type of missingness often relies on judgment, as data-based diagnostics are unavailable."

Specifically, it counts the number of new policies and renewals issued per 100 housing units. The FAIR plan is designed to provide insurance to individuals who might otherwise be unable to obtain it due to factors like redlining, which is the discriminatory practice of denying services (such as insurance) to residents of certain areas based on their race or ethnicity. So, a higher involact value indicates more FAIR plan policies and renewals in that area, suggesting that more residents are relying on this plan for their insurance needs. In other words, a higher involact value reflects a greater dependence on the FAIR plan, which could be due to factors like economic challenges or discriminatory practices in the regular insurance market.\n",

    "- Insurance redlining is the practice of denying insurance to specific people or areas. The term comes from drawing red lines on maps. While refusing auto insurance to frequent drunk drivers is generally accepted, other types of discrimination are not.\n",
    "- In the late 1970s, the US Commission on Civil Rights investigated claims from Chicago community groups that insurance companies were redlining their neighborhoods. Due to a lack of data on individuals denied homeowners insurance, they recorded the number of FAIR plan policies issued and renewed by zip code from December 1977 to May 1978. The FAIR plan was a default policy for homeowners rejected by the voluntary market. They also collected data on other factors like fire and theft rates at the zip code level."
