    "- It has 24 observations.\n",
    "- There are 14 variables, all are in thousands:\n",
    "    - El denotes electeur inscrits or registered voters.\n",
    "    - A stand for Mitterand’s in the first round.\n",
    "    - B stand for Giscard’s in the first round.\n",
    "    - A2 stand for Mitterand’s in the second round.\n",
    "    - B2 stand for Giscard’s in the first round.\n",
    "    - C-K are the ﬁrst round votes of the other candidates.\n",
    "    - The total number of voters in the second round exceeded that of the first round — we can denote this difference as N. We will treat this group as if it were another first-round candidate, although there are other reasonable ways to handle this.\n",
    "- French presidential elections are held in two rounds. In 1981, there were 10 candidates in the first round. The top two candidates advanced to the second round, where François Mitterrand defeated Valéry Giscard-d’Estaing. Candidates who lost in the first round can gain political favors by encouraging their supporters to vote for one of the finalists. Since voting is private, we can’t know exactly how these votes were transferred, but we can infer patterns from the published vote totals. Anderson and Loynes (1987) provided data on these vote totals for every fourth department in France."

    "# 3. Weighted Least Squares\n",
    "- Sometimes the errors are uncorrelated but have unequal variance where the form of the inequality is known. In such cases, Σ is diagonal but the entries are not equal. Weighted least squares (WLS) is a special case of GLS and can be used in this situation.\n",
    "- We have ${\\Sigma}=\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\frac{1}{w_1}&\\cdots&0\\\\\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\0&\\cdots&\\frac{1}{w_n}\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right)$ where $w_i$ are the weights.\n",
    "- Then $S=\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w_1}}&\\cdots&0\\\\\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\0&\\cdots&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w_n}}\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right).$\n",
    "- We regress $\\sqrt{w_i}y_i$ on $\\sqrt{w_i}x_i$\n",
    "- The first column of model matrix X is replaced with $\\sqrt{w_i}.$\n",
    "- The residuals become $\\sqrt{w_i}{\\hat{\\varepsilon}}_i.$\n",
    "- Some examples:\n",
    "    - If the variance of the errors $ε_i$ is proportional to the predictor variable $x_i (var{\\varepsilon_i\\propto x_i})$, then it might be appropriate to use the inverse of the predictor variable $(w_i\\ =\\ x_i^{-1})$ as a way to estimate the errors. This approach can be chosen when there is a positive relationship between $\\left|{\\hat{\\varepsilon}}_i\\right|$ and $x_i$ in a plot.\n",
    "    - When we have a group data with each group having $n_i$ observations. We calculate the average of each group $Y_i$. Then $var{Y_i=var{\\varepsilon_i=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_i}.}}$ It is common to encounter situations where the responses we are analyzing are actually averages. For example, when studying life expectancies in different countries, we might calculate the average life expectancy for each country. However, it is important to be cautious and ensure that the variance in the life expectancies is truly proportional to the group size (number of people in each country). If we were to set the weights (importance) of each country's average life expectancy equal to the population size of the country, it might seem reasonable at first. However, there are many other factors that contribute to the variation in life expectancies, and these factors could overshadow the effect of population size. Therefore, it is important to consider all sources of variation when determining the weights for averages.\n",
    "    - When we have observed responses that have different levels of quality. To account for this, we can assign weights to each response $w_i=\\frac{1}{var{y_i}}$. By assigning higher weights to responses with lower variance (indicating higher quality), we can give more importance to those responses in our analysis or calculations."
